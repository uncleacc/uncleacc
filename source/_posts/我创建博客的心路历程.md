>搭建好一个博客并美化完成我认为确实是我大一做的一件非常有意义的一件事，博客很有可能将来是伴随我一生的，这是我一生的财富，里面记录着我成长的点点滴滴，或许几年后的我也会感慨现在的我吧😌！博客是永远不会停更的，只要我做了我认为有记录意义的事情，我就会发布到博客上去，我也希望能帮到看到我写的文章的网友们，哪怕只是解决了一点点问题！

好了煽情的话少说，贴出我的作文

贴作文不是因为写得好，单纯只是记录一下

<p><font color="pink" size=4>
I am a student majoring in computer science. I often surf the internet in order to find some useful information. Every times when I open a website, there are always many beautiful decorations on either side of the page. Other people told me it is the blog. I was cautious about how to make it. Finally, some day, I began to create my own blog website.

I remember clearly that day, it’s on March 29, 2020. That day’s morning, I got up on six o’clock. Didn’t have breakfast, just had a simple washing, I began a lasting one whole day’s activity of building my blog website. The process was so diffcult that I could’t do anything before searching a detailed tutorial. “Everything’s hard in the beginning”. Everything was new for me. Whenever I was about to give up, I always reminded me that “Giving up is esay but persistense is diffcult”. After countless attempts, a rough blog was exposed to my eyes. In that moment, my heart almost jumped out of my belly - so excited! A moth later, I have decorated it as far as I could. Now, Its appearance sastifies me competely.

This is my unforgettable and successful memory. And I am fond of it and I trust that It will accompany me forever.
